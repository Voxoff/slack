- *Labs have been released for tonight*. Please get started on them and do as many as you can!

And a few words of wisdom from the students who have just finished mod 1:

_“Do not despair, the first week is hard but it gets easier and more fun. Do not focus too much on the code challenge. Understand what your code does”_
_“It gets better. Practise, practise, practise. You get out of it what you put into it.“_
_“Even if it seems counter-intuitive at points, like you may lose flow or something, take regular breaks, not just in terms of time, but away from code - think of it as a mental cleanse. Managing time and stress is equally as important as course content, whether on this bootcamp or any another intensive course.“_
_“Advice for mod1s - Don’t rush learning, just to get through the material. Understanding is more important than rushing through. Also make time for your classmates; explaining something to them will help you understand a topic more. Win win!“_
_“The first week can be exhausting but don’t worry, you will feel better a couple of week’s in when you have settled into the rhythm of things.“_

See you tomorrow at 9am sharp! :heart:
